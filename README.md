# Weather App

This is an app I have developed myself to learn how REST APIs work. I wanted to have a basic understanding of them, so I select [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and I use it to make request to the API to get information about the weather in different locations. Additionally, I manage this information to show it in different elements and not as a simple string. It's not the best design, but it's a starting point as before this project I didn't know nothing about React.
